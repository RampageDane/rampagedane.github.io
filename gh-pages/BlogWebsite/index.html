          <p>A straightforward clean design allows for the content that is distributed to easily acknowledge and also be separated by
            different webpages to keep a formal place for content such as video, imagery, and text.</p>
          <p> I like this website because it is so simple and clean, any sort of creative piece that would
            be posted will stand out from the website itself, which I find important when using it as a portfolio.
          </p>

          <img src="images/midnightHubBlog.png" alt="Midnight Hub" width = 99%>
          <p>Midnight Hub's Blog is designed to keep content at its forfront while keeping
             a clean look to express what is most important to them, their video game content and news.</p>
          <p>I like this website because it does what I find it most important when it comes to showing off your content,
             and that is a clean and straighforward design that shows off what they want to show. It is much like the other websites,
              but it is a fluently clean concept that I relate to most.</p>
          <h2 class="header"><a href="http://www.davidshaver.net/">David Shaver Game Design Portfolio</a></h2>
          <img src="images/davidshaverportfolio.png" alt="David Shaver" width = 99%>
          <p>David Shaverâ€™s portfolio follows a simple design by keeping everything at the forefront on one page, while making
             subpages go into greater detail for those interested. By separating content, he is capable of giving the more important
              info first, but also allowing the viewer to seek out more information with more clicks.</p>
          <p>Shaver's website has this simplicity, much like the other websites I have shown, but his gives this simplicity upfront
             on his main page. There isn't much clutter, but Shaver gives the option for people to find greater detail by clicking
              around and going to sub-pages which I find to be a great design for keeping a clean website.</p>
          <h2 class="header"><a href="http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/">Robby Leonardi</a></h2>
                    <img src="images/robbyLeonardiResume.png" alt="David Shaver" width = 99%>
          <p>Robby Leonardi is raising a higher bar in Web Development by using his expertise in illustration,
             animation and web programming. His interactive resume allows for the viewer to see information in
              a fun and interesting way by being interactions. Robby's design keeps you looking at new and interesting
               animations and illustrations which sets his website apart from others by including his works within the design of the website.</p>
          <p>I liks this website because it is plainly an etension of what the designer can do within the building blocks of the website itself.
          While there would have to be countless hours of developing such a toolset, it is one I commemorate.</p>
